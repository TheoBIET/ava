# 🤖 ava - A Virtual Assistant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

🤖 ava is your virtual assistant powered by Open-Sources AI Models and carried by [Ollama]().  
ava is one of the first artificial intelligences with a face, eyes, ears and mouth, she can help you with  
any task, just ask her a question and she'll answer.

This is a personnal project which will probably improved regularly on my free time.  
It's future is to be totally open-source and free to use for everyone who wants to use it.

Thanks to [Ollama](), [Hugging Face](), [Ready Player Me]() their amazing work who helped me bring this project to life.

- This project is currently **under development** and is not ready for production use. 🏗️
